# Mastermind-genetic-algorithm
This program has 2 options. First one allow you to play Mastermind game with your computer. In second way you chose code, and you computer try to solve it using my implementation of Genetic Algorithm 

Sorry for my english, I'm not native speaker. 

There are 3 main files: judge.py computer.py and player.py

If you want to play with computer run player.py and follow the instructions 
If you want to watch how Genetic Algorithm works run computer.py file and follow the instruction 
The last file is auxiliary

If there will be some polish words just let me know, i will fix it.
